            Traditions inherited from the Edo period. Continuously evolving
            towns and cutting-edge culture. Tokyo is a place where the two
            aspects dynamically merge, offering a myriad of attractions that
            captivate people. As experts of the constantly evolving city, let us
            introduce the newest and best of Tokyo to visitors from abroad.

            Tokyo is a leading eco-friendly city that promotes the utilization
            of renewable energy and zero emission vehicles to achieve “Zero
            Emission Tokyo” by 2050. The city is also one of the greenest cities
            in the world, with natural parks totaling 80,000 hectares in
            addition to numerous historical gardens and city parks near downtown
            areas.

            Tokyo is filled with an array of diverse cultures. Among modern
            buildings, cutting-edge fashion and animations, there are also
            traditional cultures and historic architecture alive in our daily
            lives.

      <h2>Destinations</h2>
      <section class="destinations" id="destinations">
        <h4>Imperial Palace & Tokyo Station</h4>
        <div>
          <img
            src="./img/Tokyo-Imperial-Palace.jpg"
            alt="View of Imperial Palace"
          />

          <p>
            Built upon the former site of Edo Castle—once the largest castle in
            the world—the Imperial Palace is usually only visible from afar.
            However, you can sign up for a tour of the majestic inner grounds.
            Make sure to book in advance through the Imperial Household Agency's
            website. Head to the Imperial Palace's East Gardens to stroll
            through meticulously manicured Japanese-style gardens and see the
            ancient castle walls. The gardens are open to the public. Runners
            and cyclists circle the palace regularly; join them if you have the
            chance.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Roppongi & Akasaka</h4>
        <div>
          <img
            src="./img/Roppongi & Akasaka.jpg"
            alt="Aerial view of Roppongi & Akasaka"
          />
          <p>
            Roppongi is arguably Tokyo's most popular nightlife district,
            particularly for overseas visitors. From disco in the '70s to EDM
            today, Roppongi's nightclubs welcome anyone and everyone looking to
            drink and dance. Beyond the nightclubbing scene, Roppongi and
            Akasaka are often regarded as home to Tokyo's most impressive
            galleries and art spaces. The area houses three main museums that
            make up what's commonly referred to as the "Art Triangle Roppongi":
            The National Art Center , the Mori Art Museum , and the Suntory
            Museum of Art .
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Shibuya & Shimokitazawa</h4>
        <div>
          <img
            src="./img/Shibuya & Shimokitazawa.jpg"
            alt="Picture of busy Shibuya"
          />
          <p>
            If you're looking for trendy cafes, live music, and shopping for
            Japan-only goods, these popular pockets of Tokyo provide plenty to
            do but via different angles. While Shibuya is arguably Tokyo's main
            shopping hub for new and modern items, Shimokitazawa offers the
            chance for some retro and antique bargains. Shibuya's mega shopping
            centers like the iconic 109 and brand-new Hikarie stock everything
            being worn by the young and trendy, while also offering a number of
            well-curated secondhand shops and outlets. Look out for
            independently run stores like The Sun Goes Down to find well-priced
            one-off pieces.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Nakameguro</h4>
        <div>
          <img
            src="./img/Nakameguro.jpg"
            alt="Picture of Nakameguro during Cherry Blossom Festival"
          />
          <p>
            Nakameguro or "Naka-me," as it is colloquially known, strikes a
            distinctive balance between luxury and the bohemian. For scenery,
            shopping, hairstyling, dining, cafes, and art, this area is defined
            by its cool and sophisticated atmosphere. The charm of the river
            walk is amplified tenfold in spring when the cherry trees bloom.
            Nearly every tree along the riverside explodes with cherry blossoms,
            forming a tunnel of flowers over the river. The mood is definitely
            celebratory, but while the river is considered one of the best
            places in Tokyo for flower viewing, note it's also one of the most
            crowded.

      <section class="thingsToDo" id="thingsToDo">
        <div>
          <h3>Gastronomy</h3>
          <p>
            Japanese cuisine offers an exceptionally rich and rewarding eating
            experience. While sushi, wagyu beef and kaiseki cuisine need little
            introduction, no self-respecting foodie should miss out on street
            food like yakitori and ramen either. Perhaps the epitome of Japanese
            cuisine is the kaiseki food served at ryotei (traditional Japanese
            restaurants). But the scope also includes numerous vegetarian
            varieties, river fish dishes, sushi, eel, tempura, soba, udon,
            takoyaki, okonomiyaki, yakiniku and more. Each region also has its
            own local specialties and culinary traditions in dishes unique to
            each area. Wherever you go and whatever you enjoy, why not accompany
            your meal with sake from a local brewery?
          </p>
          <div class="tips">
            <h4>Tips</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Tokyo restaurants increasingly cater to vegetarians, vegans and
                those with special dietary requirements but research and
                planning is recommended
              </li>
              <li>
                Although smoking in bars and restaurants is legal and still
                quite common in Japan, certain venues do operate non-smoking
                policies
              </li>
              <li>
                Tipping is not common practice in Tokyo or other parts of Japan
              </li>
              <li>
                Most bars and izakaya apply a seating charge and serve a
                customary small dish prior to ordering
              </li>

          <h3>Anime & Manga</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          Geisha, samurai, sushi and sumo have long been leading symbols of
          Japanese culture—or at least until recently. Nowadays, anime, manga,
          concept cafes, J-pop and uber-inventive street fashion appear to have
          taken their place, particularly for millennials and children of the
          digital age. At the center of this new cultural identity is Tokyo—a
          vibrant hotbed of Japanese pop culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          As much as anime and manga have won the hearts of people all over the
          world, they are extremely precious to many Japanese people too. Who
          knows, your recent or long-time devotion to an anime and trip to a
          treasured anime destination (anime tourism) might just be the
          foundation or spark to a lifelong relationship, whether it's friends
          or more!

              Akihabara is the beating heart of the manga and anime movement

          <h3>Shopping</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          Shopping is a pleasure with no language barrier. Discover the
          different specialties of the citys unique shopping districts. While
          you will find the same large chain stores like Uniqlo, Muji and H&M
          across Tokyo, each area has its own distinct atmosphere. From the chic
          department stores and boutiques of Ginza, the quirky youth brands of
          Harajuku to the anime and electronics paradise of Akihabara, you
          really can buy anything in Tokyo.

        <div class="tips">
          <h4>Tips</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Many stores offer tax free shopping to international visitors, so
              take your passport with you
            </li>
            <li>
              Department store basements are a great place to sample new foods
              and pick up picnic supplies
            </li>
            <li>
              Look up—with real estate at a premium, a lot of great stores and
              cafes are above ground level
            </li>
            <li>
              The price on the ticket is the price—haggling and bargaining is

          <h3>Onsen & Bathhouses</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          Japan is known for its abundance of natural hot springs, and you can
          find plenty of remarkable ones in Tokyo. Hot springs, or onsen in
          Japanese, are a vital part of Japanese culture and have countless
          health benefits. In times past, the people of Edo (Tokyo) had to
          travel to enjoy the hot springs. But today, you can enjoy the perfect
          onsen experience without leaving the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          While most people suggest Hakone or Atami in nearby prefectures for
          hot springs, you can take a dip without leaving the city. The water
          here is rich in sodium chloride and is known to help ease muscle pain,
          joint stiffness, cuts, burns, and colds. Facilities in the city center
          include Maenohara Onsen Sayano hot spring and Musashi-Koyama Onsen
          Shimizu-yu. Or visit some small local bathhouses near Kamata station
          for Kuroyu―means black hot spring, a kind of natural hot spring around
          Tokyo.
        </p>
        <div class="tips">
          <h4>Tips</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              No need to bring a bathing suit at traditional Japanese hot
              springs, neither swimsuits nor underwear are allowed
            </li>
            <li>
              Most onsen have a tattoo ban. If you have tattoos, ask the
              establishment before booking
            </li>
            <li>
              Feel free to bring your skincare favorites, but many onsen have
              amenities such as soap, shampoo, skin lotion, etc.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          Wash yourself thoroughly before entering the bath. Things like
          shampoo, conditioner, body wash, razors, and towels are typically
          provided or available for a small additional fee. Once you've rinsed
          off, tie your hair up before entering the bath if you have long hair.
          Towels are not allowed in the water. Now you can relax and enjoy the
          Japanese hot spring water.
